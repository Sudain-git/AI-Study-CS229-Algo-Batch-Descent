# AI-Study-CS229-Algo-Batch-Descent
Implimentation of a Batch Descent Learning Algorithm

Code was written by claude ai.

Main properties of batch descent is it iterates over the entire dataset and so is slow, especially for large datasets.  It also finds the absolute minimum for the dataset (the closest fit for the data).  It doesn't reduce the learning rate over time like stochastic does.
